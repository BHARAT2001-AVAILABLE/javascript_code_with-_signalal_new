// Similarly, you can convert an ASCII value back to its corresponding character using String.fromCharCode():
/*
let asciiVal = 65;
let c = String.fromCharCode(asciiVal);
console.log(`The character of ASCII value ${asciiVal} is: ${c}`);
*/

// Prints: The character of ASCII value 65 is: A


// practice

let asciival = 66;
let c = String.fromCharCode(asciival);
console.log(`The ${asciival} its char code  is ${c}`)
