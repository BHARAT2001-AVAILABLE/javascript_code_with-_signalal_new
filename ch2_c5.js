// Applications of Looping
// Loops are integral to programming. They are extensively used in various sections of a program, such as summing elements in an array and parsing through text.
/*
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let total = 0;
// `num` is each number in `numbers`
for (let num of numbers) {
    total += num; // Add each number in the array
}
console.log(total); // print the total sum
*/
// Output:
// 15

/*

let text = "hello";
let vowelCount = 0;
// `ch` is each character in `text`
for (let ch of text) {
    // If a vowel letter is found, increment the count
    if (ch === 'a' || ch === 'e' || ch === 'i' || ch === 'o' || ch === 'u') {
        vowelCount++;
    }
}
console.log(vowelCount); // print the count of vowels
*/
// Output:
// 2



// Lesson Summary and Practice
// Congratulations on mastering JavaScript loops! We've brushed up on for and while loops and have seen how to loop over containers like arrays and strings. Now, it's time for some beneficial practice exercises to solidify your learning. The more problems you solve, the better you'll become. Let's proceed further on our journey into the depths of programming!



// practice vowel count

// let text ="Javascript mastery";
// let vowelCount = 0;

// for (let ch of text) {

//     if (ch === 'a' ||  ch === 'e' || ch ==='i' || ch ==='o' || ch === 'u') {
//         vowelCount++;
//     }
// }

// console.log(vowelCount);


let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
let total = 0; 

for (let num of numbers) {
    total += num;

}

console.log(total);
