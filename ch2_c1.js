// Topic Overview
// Greetings, Explorer! In this lesson, we will delve into the essential tools of JavaScript loops. Loops in programming simplify and enhance the efficiency of repetitive tasks â€” much like a coffee maker brewing multiple cups with a single press, they automate the process, ensuring each cup is brewed quickly and consistently. In this lesson, we will explore the universe of looping in JavaScript and gain hands-on experience by applying loops to JavaScript arrays and strings.

// Understanding Looping
// Imagine listening to your favorite song on repeat. That's the concept of loops in programming. For instance, we can use a for loop to print greetings for a group of friends.

// let friends = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Daniel"];

// for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
//     // `i` is the index that changes with each iteration
//     // For each friend, print the greeting
//     console.log("Hello, " + friends[i] + "! Nice to meet you.");
// }

// Output:
// Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you.
// Hello, Bob! Nice to meet you.
// Hello, Charlie! Nice to meet you.
// Hello, Daniel! Nice to meet you.

let friends = ["bhusi bhai", "Alu bhai", "john bhai", "denim bhai"];

for (let i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
    console.log("hello " + friends[i] + ", i am back.");
}
